  CIViC variants are usually genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion events (indels), copy number alterations (CNV's such as amplification or deletion), structural variants (SVs such as translocations and inversions), and other events that differ from the "normal" genome. In some cases a CIViC variant may represent events of the transcriptome or proteome. For example, 'expression' or 'over-expression' is a valid variant. Regardless of the variant, it must have an predictive, prognostic or diagnostic clinical relevance to be entered in CIViC. New curators should generally avoid proposing new variants that are unlike any already in CIViC.
