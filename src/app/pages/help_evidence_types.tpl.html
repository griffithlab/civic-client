    When curating evidence statements from published sources, to discern whether a variant has a "clinical interpretation", we use the data model below. Evidence statements can either be predictive of drug response, be correlated with prognostic outcome, or contribute to disease diagnosis. If an evidence item can not be placed in one of these categories, it likely lies outside of the scope of CIViC. However, published statements about a gene or variant that cannot be placed within these categories can still be added to the free-form gene and variant summaries.
