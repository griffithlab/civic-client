<div class="help-sub-tab">
  <p>The rows in the following table describe the minimal components of a CIViC Evidence Item. Several Evidence Statements are synthesized at the Variant level into Variant Summaries but each Evidence Statement is directly linked to a single article in PubMed. <i>More specific guidelines about Evidence Item components can be found in additional help tabs.</i></p>

<h4>General Guidelines</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Evidence Statements should be:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>derived from primary literature sources (not review articles) whenever possible.</li>
    <li>as concise as possible while providing sufficient experiemental detail to interpret and evaluate the evidence (N values, statistics, etc).</li>
    <li>a single Predictive, Predisposing, Diagnostic or Prognostic assertion, not a combination.</li>
    <li>aimed at a general audience, avoiding field-specific acronyms and colloquialisms.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Multiple, separate Evidence Items can be and often are derived from a single publication.</li>
  <li>Generally, assertions involving drugs should be classified as being of the Predictive Evidence Type.</li>
  <li>Evidence Ratings should be based on the strength of the specific assertion. Multiple assertions from the same publication can have different evidence ratings.</li>
</ul>
