    In order to quickly discern how much trust curators and users have in a single evidence statement, a five star evidence rating system is used. Each evidence item is given a rating, from 1 to 5 stars, based on the quality of the evidence the statement summarizes. This rating depends on a number of factors, including study size, quality control, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility. It should be noted that this rating is largely subjective and may be debated (hopefully within the CIViC interface). Also the rating should be specific to the evidence statement. The overall publication/study might be high quality in a high impact publication, but the evidence statement may refer to a single conclusion in the study, and that part of the study might not be well supported. For example, the assertion may relate to patients with a particular mutation, and the study might involve an impressive 500 patients, but if only 2 patients have the mutation in question, the quality rating may be low for this evidence statement.
