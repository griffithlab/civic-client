  The CIViC Variant Evidence Score allows curators to assess the accumulation of evidence for each variant. The CIViC Variant Evidence Score is calculated by adding all Evidence Item Scores for each variant. The Evidence Item Score is calculated by multiplying the evidence level (A=10 points, B=5 points, C=3 points, D=1 point, E=0.25 points) by the trust rating (Each Star = 1 point).

  <h4>Example of how to calculate the CIViC Variant Evidence Score</h4>
  <p>Example of CIViC score determination for each DNA-based variant using the CIViC entry for EID497. Catagorization of the ‘Evidence Level’ and the ‘Evidence Rating’ creates a method for scoring each evidence item, which can be summed to create a variant score. Variant scores were used to determine panel eligibility.</p>
