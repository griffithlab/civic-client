    <p>The Variant Origin identifies whether the variant is presumed as an inherited (germline mutation) or acquired (somatic mutation) event in the context of the study. We generally consider somatic events to be the first priority, as this is an area that has not been as well addressed by existing resources. However, germline mutations with established clinical relevance are acceptable. Germline polymorphisms (>1% allele frequency in the population) are considered low priority, again unless there is an established clinical significance. Polymorphisms described in association studies should be curated with great caution and may face additional scrutiny from CIViC moderators. For some variant types, the variant origin field may be unknown or N/A. For example, EXPRESSION variants are neither germline nor somatic. Fusion variants are an unusual case in that they are often observed in the transcriptome but are usually accompanied by an underlying somatic (or germline) mutation. Most fusions should be entered as somatic. If in doubt, please note the issue at the time of your submission to encourage discussion during the moderation stage.</p>
