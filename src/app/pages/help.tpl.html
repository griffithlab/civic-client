    <h2>Introduction to the CIViC Interface</h2>
    <p> 
	  <br>To learn more about the presentation of the information in CIViC, watch this video tutorial! <br><br><iframe width="800" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KImI_oNYtyc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> This is the first installment in a four part series of the main CIViC functionality. Stay tuned for more videos! <br>

    <h2>Understanding the CIViC Data Model</h2>	
    <p>
      At the heart of CIViC is the clinical evidence statement. The clinical evidence statement is a piece of information that has been manually curated from trustable medical literature about a variant or genomic 'event' that has implications in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, or predictive response to therapy. For example, “Patients with BRAF V600 mutations respond well to the drug dabrafenib”. A variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA gene fusion, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), and others. Each clinical evidence statement corresponds to a single citable publication.<br><br>

      The following tables define the minimal components and definitions required for a CIViC evidence statement. Once clinical evidence statements for a variant have been curated, a summary is manually generated describing the variant's significance in cancer, along with current treatment methods. A gene level summary then synthesizes the variant summaries, and adds important gene-level information. Each variant can belong to one or more variant groups, these act to combine functionally similar variants into a single entity.  For example, 'FGFR Fusions' is a group that contains several gene fusions where FGFR2 (or FGFR3) is involved in a fusion with various 3' partner genes, and 'Imatinib Resistance Mutations' is a group of variants that confer resistance to imatinib treatment.

    <h3>Breaking Down the Evidence Statement</h3>
    <p>
      When curating evidence statements from published sources, to discern whether a variant has a "clinical interpretation", we use the data model below. Evidence statements can either be predictive of drug response, be correlated with prognostic outcome, or contribute to disease diagnosis. If an evidence item can not be placed in one of these categories, it likely lies outside of the scope of CIViC. However, published statements about a gene or variant that cannot be placed within these categories can still be added to the free-form clinical summary and variant summary.

    <h3>Evidence Levels: Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Each evidence statement is the result of an experiment, trial or study in published literature. It is important to capture the nature of these experiments in the evidence entry. Evidence levels allow for the subject of an evidence item to be presented in a simple, standardized fashion.

    <h3>Trust Ratings Explained</h3>
    <p>
      In order to quickly discern how much trust curators and users have in a single evidence statement, a five star trust ratings system is used. Each evidence item is given a rating, from 1 to 5 stars, based on the quality of the source from which the evidence is curated. These ratings depend on a number of factors, including journal impact, control quality, orthogonal validation, and reproducibility.

        <th>Definition</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1 star</td>
        <td>Claim is not supported well by experimental evidence. Results are not reproducible, or have very small sample size. No follow-up is done to validate novel claims.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2 stars</td>
        <td>Evidence is not well supported by experimental data, and little follow-up data is available. Publication is from a journal with low academic impact. Experiments may lack proper controls, have small sample size, or are not statistically convincing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3 stars</td>
        <td>Evidence is convincing, but not supported by a breadth of experiments. May be smaller scale projects, or novel results without many follow-up experiments. Discrepancies from expected results are explained and not concerning.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4 stars</td>
        <td>Strong, well supported evidence. Experiments are well controlled, and results are convincing. Any discrepancies from expected results are well-explained and not concerning.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>5 stars</td>
        <td>Strong, well supported evidence from a lab or journal with respected academic standing. Experiments are well controlled, and results are clean and reproducible across multiple replicates. Evidence confirmed using independent methods.</td>
