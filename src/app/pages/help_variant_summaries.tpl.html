  The Variant Summary is a user-defined description of the clinical relevance of this Variant. This description should discuss the Variant’s relevance to different cancer types, patient outcomes and treatment decisions. It can be thought of as an executive summary of what information a clinician would like to know about a Variant identified in a patient tumor.</p>
  <p>
  The Summary is mostly a synthesis of the Evidence Statements available for the Variant. Although individual Evidence Statements do not capture biological/mechanistic impact of Variants on gene function, such information can be summarized briefly here. Since the Summary is a synthesis of Evidence Statements in CIViC, we recommend that a Variant Summary only be created after the number of Evidence Statements created for a Variant are a reasonable reflection of the state of the literature. As a simple rule of thumb, if a variant has less than 5-10 evidence statements (or higher for some variants), the Variant is probably NOT ready for a Variant Summary yet. </p>

  <h4>Sources</h4>
  Although in-line citations are not currently supported, the addition of citations used to generate the Variant Summary beyond those captured in the Evidence Statements, particularly relevant reviews, is highly encouraged with the intention of directing other users to more in-depth information about the Variant. This can be accomplished using the Sources field and entered by specifying the PubMed ID associated with the publication.</p>
